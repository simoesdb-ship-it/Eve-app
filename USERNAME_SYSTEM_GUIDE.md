# Anonymous Username System Guide

## Overview
The app features a unique anonymous identity system that generates memorable two-word usernames for each device while maintaining complete privacy. This system enables community participation without compromising user anonymity.

## How It Works

### Username Generation
- **Unique Identity**: Each device gets a permanent username like "Swift Falcon" or "Calm River"
- **Privacy First**: No personal information required - based on device fingerprinting
- **Consistent**: Your username stays the same across all app sessions
- **Memorable**: Combination of 100 adjectives and 100 nouns creates 10,000 possible usernames

### Visual Identity
- **Colored Avatars**: Each username gets a unique background color
- **Initials Display**: Shows first letters of both words (e.g., "SF" for "Swift Falcon")
- **Consistent Styling**: Same visual identity across all app features
