# Anonymous User Identity System

## How Your Unique Identity Works

When you first use the Pattern Discovery app, you automatically get a unique anonymous identity that consists of:

### 1. Two-Word Fictitious Username
- **Example**: "Swift Falcon", "Calm River", "Bright Explorer"
- Generated from your device's unique characteristics
- **Always the same** when you return to the app
- Completely anonymous - no personal information required

### 2. Unique Anonymous ID
- A long string of characters (like `anon_abc123_timestamp`)
- Used internally by the app to track your contributions
- Never reveals your real identity

### 3. Colored Avatar
- Your username generates a unique color
- Shows your initials in a colored circle
- Makes you recognizable in the community without revealing identity

## Privacy Protection
