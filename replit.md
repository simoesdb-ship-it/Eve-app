# Pattern Discovery App - Compressed Overview

## Overview
This mobile-first web application facilitates the discovery of Christopher Alexander's architectural patterns in the real world through a peer-to-peer data economy. It prioritizes anonymous user identity, location-based pattern discovery, and a token-based data marketplace, allowing users to explore and contribute to a shared understanding of architectural patterns. The project envisions a future where urban development is guided by community insights derived from real-world pattern analysis.
