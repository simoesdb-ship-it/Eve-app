# Final React Native Metro Fix

The Connect middleware error is a known issue with React Native 0.76+. 

## Updated Solutions:

### Option 1: Safe Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd mobile
npm run start-safe
```

### Option 2: Alternative Port
```bash
cd mobile
npm run start-clean
```

### Option 3: Direct CLI
```bash
cd mobile
npx @react-native-community/cli start --port 8082 --reset-cache
```

## What's Fixed:
- Enhanced middleware checking to prevent undefined handle errors
- Changed to port 8082 to avoid conflicts
- Added direct CLI fallback option
- Disabled symlinks for stability
