# App Streamlining Analysis

## Current Navigation Issues (7 tabs - too many!)

### Current tabs:
1. **Map** - Location discovery and tracking
2. **Activity** - User activity feed and stats  
3. **Groups** - Community analysis
4. **Patterns** - Pattern exploration
5. **Tokens** - Token wallet and balance
6. **Market** - Data marketplace
7. **Settings** - User settings

## Consolidation Strategy

### Merge Economy Functions (Tokens + Market → "Economy")
- Token wallet and data marketplace are both economic functions
- Users think of them as one unified economy system
- Combine into single "Economy" tab with sub-navigation

### Merge Analysis Functions (Activity + Groups → "Insights") 
- Activity feed and community analysis are both data insights
- Both show analytical views of collected data
- Combine into "Insights" tab with toggle between personal/community

### Keep Core Functions Separate
- **Map** - Primary location interaction (core function)
- **Patterns** - Pattern discovery (core Alexander functionality)
- **Settings** - Configuration (standard app function)

## New Streamlined Structure (5 tabs)

1. **Map** (Compass icon) - Location discovery, tracking, voting
2. **Insights** (TrendingUp icon) - Personal activity + Community analysis  
3. **Patterns** (Grid3X3 icon) - Pattern exploration and matching
4. **Economy** (Coins icon) - Token wallet + Data marketplace
5. **Settings** (Settings icon) - User preferences

## Benefits

### User Experience:
- Cleaner navigation with optimal 5-tab structure
- Related functions grouped logically
- Reduced cognitive load for users
- Faster navigation between related features

### Development:
- Less redundant navigation code
- Consolidated related state management
- Easier maintenance and updates
- More cohesive feature organization

## Implementation Plan

1. Create unified Economy page with tabs for Wallet/Marketplace
2. Create unified Insights page with tabs for Activity/Community  
3. Update bottom navigation to 5 consolidated tabs
4. Ensure all existing functionality remains accessible
5. Test navigation flows and user experience
