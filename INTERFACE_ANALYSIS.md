- Live GPS integration with pattern confidence scoring
- Dynamic pattern updates as user moves
- Community voting integration for pattern relevance

### 2. Community Voting System
**Location:** `client/src/pages/community-demo.tsx`
**Issue:** Voting buttons work but use mock data, no backend integration
**Status:** UI functional, backend disconnected
**Development Needed:**
- Connect voting to database storage
- Implement vote weighting based on location time
- Real-time vote count updates
- Community consensus scoring

### 3. Pattern Detail Interactions
**Location:** `client/src/pages/pattern-detail.tsx`
**Issue:** Save, vote, and share buttons are non-functional
**Status:** Placeholder buttons with no backend actions
**Development Needed:**
- Save pattern functionality
- Location-based pattern voting
- Social sharing integration
- Pattern implementation tracking

### 4. Live Activity Feed
**Location:** `client/src/pages/activity.tsx`
**Issue:** Activity feed shows database content but lacks real-time updates
**Status:** Static data display
**Development Needed:**
- Real-time activity streaming
- Live notification system
- Community activity integration
- Movement-triggered activity logging

### 5. Token Earning Automation
**Location:** `client/src/pages/economy.tsx`
**Issue:** Token earning is manual, not automated based on GPS tracking
**Status:** Manual token distribution only
**Development Needed:**
- Automatic token rewards for GPS data
- Real-time balance updates
- Movement-based reward calculation
- Spatial data quality bonuses

## Secondary Placeholder Functions

### 6. Data Marketplace Upload
**Location:** `client/src/pages/data-marketplace.tsx`
**Issue:** Create package form exists but doesn't capture actual spatial data
**Status:** Form interface without data integration
**Development Needed:**
- Automatic spatial data packaging
- GPS track bundling for sale
- Quality metrics for pricing
- Automated data validation

### 7. Location Saving System
**Location:** Multiple pages (`discover.tsx`, `activity.tsx`)
**Issue:** Save location buttons don't persist or categorize locations
**Status:** Basic database storage, no categorization
**Development Needed:**
- Location categorization system
- Pattern-based location tagging
- Personal location collections
- Location sharing with community

### 8. Pattern Implementation Guidance
**Location:** `client/src/pages/enhanced-pattern-demo.tsx`
**Issue:** Implementation guidance is static text
**Status:** Static documentation display
**Development Needed:**
- Location-specific implementation advice
- Real-world constraint analysis
- Cost estimation for implementations
- Community implementation examples

## Minor Interface Issues

### 9. Search Functionality
**Location:** `client/src/pages/patterns.tsx`
**Issue:** Pattern search works but could be enhanced with location relevance
**Status:** Basic text search functional
**Enhancement Needed:**
- Location-relevant pattern filtering
- Distance-based pattern suggestions
- Historical pattern search
- Community-tagged pattern search

### 10. Settings and Preferences
**Location:** `client/src/pages/settings.tsx`
**Issue:** Settings page may lack GPS precision controls
**Status:** Needs investigation
**Development Needed:**
- GPS tracking precision settings
- Privacy controls for data sharing
- Notification preferences
- Export/import user data
